# Advent of Code 2019

I've decided to take the opportunity to learn a bit of
[Crystal](crystal-lang.org) during this years Advent of Code.

Most solutions are written in Ruby first since I can do that quickly, then
ported to Crystal (which is usually trivial).

Depends on Crystal, Ruby, and [redo](https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for the build.
